  "description": "Add a new transaction type whose validity and gas payment can be defined abstractly. Instead of relying solely on a single ECDSA signature, accounts may freely define and interpret their signature scheme using any cryptographic system, enabling post-quantum security and native account abstraction.",

  "laymanDescription": "A new transaction type that lets your account use any method to prove you authorized it, not just the current signature system. This enables quantum-resistant signatures, smart wallets with features like recovery and spending limits, and lets others pay your transaction fees natively.",
